DynamoUnfold
============

Library for building topology from sets of surfaces and unfolding them using Protogeometry tools in Dynamo

Includes References to
* DynamoCore
* Nunit
* DynamoText
* Protogeometry

###Building / Installing###
*Building this library requires that you have also cloned the Dynamo Project repo and DynamoText Project repo*
**These projects must be located in the same directory as DynamoUnfold has been cloned to**
####Steps
- Clone Dynamo [DynamoRepo](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo)
- Build Dynamo
- Clone DynamoText [DynamoTextRepo](https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoText)
- Build DynamoText
- Clone DynamoUnfold - *you are here*
- Build DynamoUnfold

The reason for this build order is to ensure that both DynamoText and DynamoUnfold are referencing the same version of the geometry library interfaces and the Dynamo Core.
